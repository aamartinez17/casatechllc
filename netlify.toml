# This is a Netlify configuration file.
# It allows you to define build settings, redirects, and more.

[build]
  # This is the command to build your Vue project.
  # It assumes you are using Vue CLI or Vite's default build script.

  # This is the directory that Netlify will deploy.
  # Vue CLI and Vite typically build to the 'dist' directory.

[[redirects]]
  # This rule is the equivalent of the one in the _redirects file.
  # It tells Netlify to serve the index.html file for any path that isn't a file.
  # This is the key to making client-side routing work.
